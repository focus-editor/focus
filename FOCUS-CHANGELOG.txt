# KNOWN BUGS

- See https://github.com/focus-editor/focus/issues


# Main Git Branch

+ New features:
    + New build option: `clear_build_output_before_running`. Set to `true` to clear the build output window every time a command is run.
    + macOS: `Opt` is now allowed in keybinds rather than `Alt`.
    + macOS: colored title bars are now used by default
+ Bug fixes:
    + macOS: added `NSHighResolutionCapable` to `Info.plist` which should fix blurry rendering when installing Focus via the `.dmg` package.
    + macOS: keyboard shortcuts should now work correctly on non-QWERTY layouts (https://github.com/focus-editor/focus/issues/29)
        - NOTE: key composition still does not work correctly, this fix is only about the base keyboard layout being respected
    + Fixed a crash when attempting to override key mappings in a project config
+ Other changes:
    + macOS: Installing the editor from the `.dmg` package will register it as a handler for text files. This means that:
        1. you will see Focus as an entry in the "Open With" list in the context menu for text files in Finder
        2. you can use Focus to open files from the terminal by running `open -a Focus file`
    + macOS: Some default keyboard shortcuts were changed to remove conflicts with system shortcuts.
    + macOS: The oldest OS that can launch Focus is now macOS 10.13 High Sierra.


# RELEASES ==================================================================


# Version 0.3.1

+ New features:
    + New options: `save_current_buffer_on_build` and `save_all_file_backed_buffers_on_build`. Enable to auto-save files before running build commands (thanks @jlami)
    + Zig highlighting
+ Bug fixes:
    + Previewing themes will now change window border color as well as it should (thanks @jmpstar)
    + Regex search should no longer crash the editor on certain inputs
    + Close current editor when animations are disabled should now focus the remaining editor
    + Binary files should now be auto-ignored again
    + Fixed a memcpy-related memory corruption bug which manifested in some rare Linux distros
+ Other changes:
    + Various theme improvements (thanks @jmpstar, @Leonader, @maxamundsen)
    + Crash reports now print stack traces in release mode where possible (thanks @Sanian-Creations)
    + Upgraded to Jai 0.1.83+ (thanks @valignatev)
    + C highlighting improvements
    + Linux: the editor now uses libxcb to interact with an X11 server by default. The old X11 backend (Xlib) is still around and can be activated by running the editor with `FOCUS_LD_BACKEND=x11` set in the environment
        + NOTE: the xcb backend is currently missing drag-and-drop support. If that is important to you please use the old Xlib backend as described above.
    + Platform support enchancements for macOS:
        + the editor no longer consumes CPU when idle
        + implemented the refresh timer (2024, year of the blinking cursor)
        + smoother trackpad scrolling
        + the `maximize_on_start` option now actually maximizes the main window instead of making it full-screen


# Version 0.3.0

+ New features:
    + An automatic config migration system. All configs will be bumped to version [2], with new things added or renamed where needed.
    + Windows 11+: New config option: `colored_titlebar`. Sets the color of the title bar to the background color (thanks @amasondev)
    + New option: `hide_mouse_when_typing` (currently Windows/Mac only). Set to `true` to hide the mouse cursor when entering text (thanks @amasondev)
    + New commands: `add_cursors_to_line_ends` (Alt-Shift-I) and `add_cursors_to_line_starts` (Alt-Shift-Ctrl-I)
    + New command: `align_cursors` (Alt-A). Can be used to align the indentation for multiple cursors (thanks @hfr4)
    + New command: `show_default_config`. Can be used to view the default editor config for your reference (readonly)
    + New command: `select_all_occurrences`. Used to create a cursor on each selection occurrence (thanks @hfr4)
    + New command: `toggle_fullscreen`. Defaults to F11 (thanks @ustance)
    + New command: `close_project`. Can be used to (surprise!) close the active project
    + New command: `swap_selections`. Can swap two selected pieces of text (thanks @hfr4)
    + New command: `escape`. Tries to close dialogs, remove additional cursors, etc. You can just bind it to `Escape` in `[common]` and forget.
    + New option: `highlight_line_with_cursor` (thanks @SentientCoffee)
    + New option: `draw_indent_guides`. Set to `true` to draw a vertical guide line at every indent level (determined by tab size)
    + New option: `auto_surround_with_brackets_and_quotes` to enable auto-surrounding (thanks @hfr4)
    + New option: `scroll_beyond_last_line` (defaults to `true`). Disable to prevent scrolling past the editor's last line
    + New option: `show_cursors_off_screen` (defaults to `true`). If enabled, displays a warning in the footer if there are cursors off screen (only when more than one is used)
    + New option: `persist_local_search_results` (defaults to `false`). If enabled, search highlights will persist even when the search bar is closed. Press escape to dismiss (you might need to bind the `escape` action for it to work). (thanks @amasondev)
    + Added support for regular expressions in file/project search
    + Added a built-in 'save file' dialog (it will be on by default). To use the system dialogs on Windows, use `prefer_system_file_dialogs: true`
    + Dragging with the middle mouse button will create cursors (thanks @hfr4)
    + Added an indicator showing if there are any cursors off screen (if you have more than one)
    + Mac: You can now set `maximize_on_start` in your global config to `true`, and Focus will launch in fullscreen.
    + New syntax highlighting:
        + Python
        + HTML/XML (thanks @arjenwitteveen)
        + Odin (thanks @SentientCoffee)
        + Yang (thanks @jmpstar)
        + Lua (thanks @SentientCoffee)
    + Numpad keys can now be used in key mappings.
      The editor now recognizes the following new key names:
        Numpad0 - Numpad9
        NumpadMultiply
        NumpadDivide
        NumpadAdd
        NumpadSubtract

    + Build system:
        + New config options:
            + `build_panel_width_percent`, `build_panel_height_percent` - how much space the build panel occupies. Both default to 50%.
            + `build_panel_stays_in_one_place`. Defaults to `false`. If disabled, then the panel will flip to the other side of the active pane.
        + Check an example build configuration in the example project or in the default config (use the show default config command)
        + Thanks to the Jai beta user Jakob for writing the first version of the build system
    + New code color: `code_warning`. Used to highlight things such as duplicate key binding etc.
    + New dialog: Switch Between Open Files (defaults to Ctrl-Tab)
    + Support horizontal scrolling with trackpads/mice with horizontal scroll wheels.

+ Bug fixes:
    + Mac: Fixed intermittent crashing on launch
    + It should now be possible to scroll the viewport by dragging outside it in all cases (previously it wasn't always possible - see issue #101)
    + Duplicating a line near the end now duplicates a line as expected
    + Fixed a bug with multi-cursor copying/pasting when some of the cursors don't have a selection
    + Fixed a bug with multi-cursor range replace by typing
    + Fixed a bug with move_lines_up/down near EOF whilst using multi-cursor
    + Fixed visual bug where tabs would align to the wrong columns
    + Fix `toggle_comment` command when tabs are enabled (thanks @Sanian-Creations)
    + Linux: fixed selection while scrolling due to "stuck" START and END states of the mouse button presses.
    + Linux: Clipboard handling should become way faster on X11 because we let event loop to handle more requests before drawing.
    + Linux: fix drag-n-drop crash caused by calling Basic.free on the memory allocated with temp allocator
    + Fix for stuck keys when the editor loses window focus (such as alt-tabbing or moving to other workspaces on Linux)
    + Improved scrolling smoothness (thanks @Sanian-Creations)
    + Parent directories of files outside of project directories are no longer recursively watched for changes. The editor should no longer hang for a long time when opening a file inside a large directory.
    + Directories created within the project shouldn't get themselves any buffers any more
    + Newer user messages will stop dismissing older ones which have a longer lifetime
    + Fixed a crash when trying to rewind editor history after reloading workspace
    + Fixed a crash when searching with whole word match on
    + Aligned missing shortcuts on the welcome screen

+ Other changes:
    + When the workspace is done scanning, the open file dialog input will no longer be cleared
    + Limited Windows 7 support (no dpi awareness)
    + Better word detection by commands that move cursors by word
    + Config highlighting has become smarter and hopefully more helpful
    + Improved CPU usage when selecting text by mouse
    + Tab characters are now only shown when they are within selection
    + Windows: better handling of Unicode input (thanks @ostef)
    + Fuzzy match improvements in dialogs


# Version 0.2.0

+ BREAKING CHANGE: the default config is no longer used as a fallback for missing keymaps, so anything you haven't listed explicitly in the global config won't be included. It's best to start with a fresh config if possible to ensure you have all the most recent options. In the future the plan is to have a config migration system which will add new options or rename/remove existing ones

+ New features:
    + Line numbers can now be enabled (default shortcut is Alt-Shift-L). To enable permanently, use `show_line_numbers: true` in the config
    + Line wrap is now supported (use the toggle_line_wrap command - the default shortcut on Windows is Alt-Z). If you want line wrap to be on by default, use `line_wrap_is_on_by_default: true`. There is currently no way to enable line wrap for certain file types only, but that's coming later.
    + New command: toggle_block_comment (for the supported languages)
    + New command: autoindent_region (bound to Ctrl-Tab by default on Windows/Linux, Option-Tab on Mac). Works with the C-like languages we have syntax highlighting for. Should work similarly to Emacs.
    + New command: delete_current_file. Not bound to anything by default, but can be used from the commands dialog (thanks @SentientCoffee)
    + New command: save_as. Also not bound to any key combination by default (thanks @SentientCoffee)
    + New commands: move_to_previous_buffer, move_to_next_buffer. They work like normal editor history, but skip the cursor movements and jump right to the next buffer or layout change
    + New config option: cursor_blink_time_in_seconds (5 by default). Set to 0 if you don't want the cursors to blink at all.
    + It is now possible to paste whatever was copied with N cursors into another file as long as the number of cursors there is also N (thanks @hfr4)
    + Syntax highlighting for GLSL (thanks @SentientCoffee)
    + Syntax highlighting for Golang (thanks @OlyaIvanovs)
    + Linux: The "Open Projects Directory" command as well as shift-clicking files/directories in the "open file" dialogs (Ctrl+O, Ctrl+Shift+O, Ctrl+P) should now work.
      By default the editor will try to auto-detect the preferred file manager using the XDG utilities.
      In case the auto-detection fails you can manually set the commands to run via the "explorer_command" and "explorer_reveal_command" options in the "[[linux]]" section of the config file.
      Example:

        [[linux]]
        # '%s' is replaced with the path of the file/directory to open
        explorer_command:         konsole -e mc "%s"      # this command is used when opening a directory
        explorer_reveal_command:  nautilus --select "%s"  # this command is used when highlighting a specific file in a directory

+ Bug fixes:
    + Focus will fall back to a slower hash function on CPUs which don't support AES instructions instead of crashing
    + When opening a file outside of workspace the editor should no longer scan its parent folder and its subfolders (but tell us if it still does)
    + Mac: Focus no longer collects window events when another window is active. This eliminates several bugs (Cmd+Tab spawning cursors, I-Beam cursor when using other apps) at the cost of no longer being able to vertically scroll unless Focus is active. For now.
    + Fixed a bug with the Navigate to file dialog being empty
    + Fixed a bug with global search not finding everything when case sensitive or whole word toggles are just turned on
    + Fixed several issues in the editor history
    + Linux: fixed a bug related to mouse cursor handling which caused slowdowns and cursor flickering on X11 (thanks @valignatev)
    + Linux: there's now a VERY basic save file dialog for new files (thanks @rexim)

+ Other changes:
    + `copy` will now copy whole lines to clipboard if the config option `copy_whole_line_without_selection` is enabled in config
    + Delete-to-start/end-of-line commands now copy whatever was deleted
    + Added #ifdef/#ifndef highlighting to C/C++
    + Added #compile_time/#no_debug/#no_aoc highlighting to Jai
    + Multi-cursor line cuts will no longer include extra newlines
    + When adding cursors above/below it's now possible to easily remove the last added cursor by executing the opposite command (thanks @WWilliams741)
    + Added a notification about match case or match whole word toggles active when no search results found
    + When editor width is limited in settings, the non-editor part of the window will be colored using the `background_dark` color
    + Linux: The editor shoudn't use any CPU while idle.
    + Linux: timers are now supported. As a result some animations (such as the text cursor blinking) should now actually work as expected.
    + Linux: More robust and resilent mechanism to get user's locale and input method for X11 backend. Fix locale-related segfaults
    + Linux: Improve smooth scrolling performance.
    + Global search will now try to preserve search results and cursor position when searching using the same query
    + Windows: The editor window should open on the primary monitor by default


# Version 0.1.10

+ Key chord support (thanks @arjenwitteveen): you can now bind a sequence of key combos to an action, e.g. `Ctrl-A Ctrl-K  <action_name>`
+ Case-sensitive and whole-word search toggles (use new commands `toggle_case_sensitive` & `toggle_whole_word` in the [search dialog] context). The default shortcuts are Alt+C/Alt+W on Windows/Linux and Cmd+Opt+C/Cmd+Opt+W on Mac. (Thanks @hfr4!)
+ Windows/Mac: You can now shift+click files/folders in dialog boxes to reveal them in Explorer. (Finder on Mac)
+ Windows/Mac: New keyboard shortcut command: `open_entry_in_explorer`. This will, like the previous item, open a file selected in a dialog box in Explorer/Finder. The default shortcut is Shift+Enter
+ Mac: Keyboard shortcuts for editing text now match other applications even more by default
+ Mac: The app's icon was brightened
+ Basic C# syntax highlighing (thanks @audV)
+ New shortcut to center viewport on cursor: `center_viewport_on_cursor` (thanks @onelivesleft)
+ Basic editor history (thanks @onelivesleft). Use commands `move_to_previous_editor_history`/`move_to_next_editor_history` to go back to previous/next cursor position (Alt-Minus, Alt-Plus by default)
+ Duplicating an editor on the side will now duplicate cursors and viewport position (thanks @hfr4)


# Version 0.1.9, 21 May 2023

+ Horizontal scrolling is now supported either with keyboard (default shortcuts - Alt-H/L) or with Shift-Mousewheel. Note that a horizontal scrollbar is not planned
+ Default keybinds on macOS have been revised to be more natural - your current bindings may conflict with the new ones
+ Windows: the save file dialog is now modal
+ Window title is now properly updated when activating panes by clicking
+ Workspace dir names with a dot will now be displayed correctly
+ Workspace dirs with similar names should now be disambiguated
+ Fixed editor commands executed using the command popup
+ Windows/Linux: you can now specify the name of any TrueType/OpenType font face that you have installed on the system and the editor will try to automatically find the correct font file for it (for example, if you have `font: courier new` in your config on a Windows system, the editor will automatically load `C:\Windows\Fonts\cour.ttf`). On Linux we use `libfontconfig` to match font face names to font files that are installed in the system. Please note that this auto-detection logic is just an addition to the existing behavior of the `font` config option (meaning that you can still specify paths to specific font files just as before). MacOS implementation will come in a future release.
+ Linux/Mac: the editor should no longer constantly redraw while idle
+ "quit" is now a bindable action, bound to Alt-F4 by default


# Version 0.1.8, 12 May 2023

+ New actions: create_cursor_above and create_cursor_below. By default bound to Alt-Shift-ArrowUp/ArrowDown - your current bindings may conflict with the default one
+ switch_to_project now has a default binding - Ctrl-Alt-P
+ Windows: Fixed config hot-reloading, which broke in 0.1.7
+ Windows: Fixed crash report messages
+ Configs will now load with warnings if workspace dirs specified do not exist


# Version 0.1.7, 11 May 2023

+ Navigate To File dialog now opens relative to the current open file
+ The Navigate dialog will now expand if the list of open folders doesn't fit
+ The editor will no longer crash if there are empty lines before the version number in the config file
+ Now Cmd is used instead of Ctrl on macOS when deciding whether to open a file on the side etc.
+ It is now possible to choose a side where to open a file when executing commands that open files (e.g. `Open Global Config`), like you would with the open file dialog
+ Ctrl-double/triple clicking and dragging now behaves as expected in terms of creating multiple cursors
+ Ctrl-click on a cursor will remove it
+ Mac Config (Global + Projects) are now stored in the current user's Application Support directory. To transfer your old configs, run the new Focus app once, then replace the newly-generated configs in `/Users/YOURNAME/Application Support/dev.focus-editor`
+ New icon for macOS
+ Now shipping .dmg disk images for Mac. To install Focus, drag Focus.app into your Applications directory. Then just double-click it like any other app.
+ [Linux] The editor now looks for the global and per-project configuration files under `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/focus-editor` (usually `$HOME/.config/focus-editor`). When upgrading from an older version you will need to manually move/copy your existing `global.focus-config` file and `projects/` directory to the new location
+ [Linux] Logs and session data are now saved under `$XDG_DATA_HOME/focus-editor` (usually `$HOME/.local/share/focus-editor`)

+ The editor will no longer open on the biggest monitor and maximized by default
+ Fix setting UTF8 window titles on Linux/X11
+ Linux: added the ability to set a fixed scaling factor
+ Basic C highlighting (currently applied to C++ as well)

+ When a file is created in the editor, its saving and hot-reloading should now work properly
+ The example config file has been stripped down to avoid confusion
+ When the workspace is reloaded, the visible files should no longer disappear
+ Shortcuts for project-related commands should work now (while no other popups are open only for now)
+ Opening a file from the command line on Linux should no longer segfault
+ Font horizontal spacing has been fixed
+ It is now possible to configure line height scale in the config. Just add `line_height_scale_percent:  <number>`. Default: 120


# Version 0.1.4, 1 May 2023

+ Basic Linux Support (thanks to @ileonte)
+ Added crash reports on failed asserts and violated array bounds
+ Smooth scrolling is fixed
+ Config hot reload should work even if it's within one of the ignored dirs
+ On Windows files with path longer than 248 bytes will be ignored to avoid a crash (probably a temporary solution)

+ Fixed a bug with the file watcher being used while uninitialized.
+ Added some shortcuts to the unsaved files dialog (Y/S to save, N to not save, C to cancel)
+ Fixed a bug with the biggest monitor being incorrectly determined on Windows (thanks to @jlami)
