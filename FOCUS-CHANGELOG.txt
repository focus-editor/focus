- Case-sensitive search
- Global search improvements (the ability to filter additionally by filename)
- Backup unsaved changes
- Highlight other languages
- Improve smooth scrolling for fancy mice
- Undo/redo for UI
- Identifier search
- A little bit of semantic highlighting for Jai
- Settings per file type
- Custom title bar
- Proper highlighting for C++
- ...


# KNOWN BUGS

- (IMPORTANT) Sometimes when pulling changes via Git, the editor won't notice the files changing (NOTE: if you have a repro please send it to us!)
- Changing some keymap bindings requires a restart to take effect
- [Current file watcher limitation] If you open a file in a large folder, the file watcher might scan the whole folder in order to watch for the changes to the file.
- Linux and macOS: the editor runs hot on the CPU


# Main Git Branch

+ Horizontal scrolling is now supported either with keyboard (default shortcuts - Alt-H/L) or with Shift-Mousewheel. Note that a horizontal scrollbar is not planned
+ Default keybinds on macOS have been revised to be more natural - your current bindings may conflict with the new ones
+ Windows: the save file dialog is now modal
+ Window title is now properly updated when activating panes by clicking
+ Workspace dir names with a dot will now be displayed correctly
+ Workspace dirs with similar names should now be disambiguated
+ Fixed editor commands executed using the command popup
+ Windows/Linux: you can now specify the name of any TrueType/OpenType font face that you have installed on the system and the editor will try to automatically find the correct font file for it (for example, if you have `font: courier new` in your config on a Windows system, the editor will automatically load `C:\Windows\Fonts\cour.ttf`). On Linux we use `libfontconfig` to match font face names to font files that are installed in the system. Please note that this auto-detection logic is just an addition to the existing behavior of the `font` config option (meaning that you can still specify paths to specific font files just as before). MacOS implementation will come in a future release.


# RELEASES ==================================================================


# Version 0.1.8, 12 May 2023

+ New actions: create_cursor_above and create_cursor_below. By default bound to Alt-Shift-ArrowUp/ArrowDown - your current bindings may conflict with the default one
+ switch_to_project now has a default binding - Ctrl-Alt-P
+ Windows: Fixed config hot-reloading, which broke in 0.1.7
+ Windows: Fixed crash report messages
+ Configs will now load with warnings if workspace dirs specified do not exist


# Version 0.1.7, 11 May 2023

+ Navigate To File dialog now opens relative to the current open file
+ The Navigate dialog will now expand if the list of open folders doesn't fit
+ The editor will no longer crash if there are empty lines before the version number in the config file
+ Now Cmd is used instead of Ctrl on macOS when deciding whether to open a file on the side etc.
+ It is now possible to choose a side where to open a file when executing commands that open files (e.g. `Open Global Config`), like you would with the open file dialog
+ Ctrl-double/triple clicking and dragging now behaves as expected in terms of creating multiple cursors
+ Ctrl-click on a cursor will remove it
+ Mac Config (Global + Projects) are now stored in the current user's Application Support directory. To transfer your old configs, run the new Focus app once, then replace the newly-generated configs in `/Users/YOURNAME/Application Support/dev.focus-editor`
+ New icon for macOS
+ Now shipping .dmg disk images for Mac. To install Focus, drag Focus.app into your Applications directory. Then just double-click it like any other app.
+ [Linux] The editor now looks for the global and per-project configuration files under `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/focus-editor` (usually `$HOME/.config/focus-editor`). When upgrading from an older version you will need to manually move/copy your existing `global.focus-config` file and `projects/` directory to the new location
+ [Linux] Logs and session data are now saved under `$XDG_DATA_HOME/focus-editor` (usually `$HOME/.local/share/focus-editor`)


# Version 0.1.6, 6 May 2023

+ The editor will no longer open on the biggest monitor and maximized by default
+ Fix setting UTF8 window titles on Linux/X11
+ Linux: added the ability to set a fixed scaling factor
+ Basic C highlighting (currently applied to C++ as well)
+ Fix the race condition when creating new files while the workspace is being scanned (thanks to @StevenSavold)
+ The macOS version now has Cmd key support and a separate config file - thanks to @rluba
+ Logging in threads is now supported - thanks to @ostef
+ On Linux the Meta or Super keys can now be used in keymaps


# Version 0.1.5, 4 May 2023

+ When a file is created in the editor, its saving and hot-reloading should now work properly
+ The example config file has been stripped down to avoid confusion
+ When the workspace is reloaded, the visible files should no longer disappear
+ Shortcuts for project-related commands should work now (while no other popups are open only for now)
+ Opening a file from the command line on Linux should no longer segfault
+ Font horizontal spacing has been fixed

+ Added crash reports on failed asserts and violated array bounds
+ Smooth scrolling is fixed
+ Config hot reload should work even if it's within one of the ignored dirs

+ Fixed a bug with the file watcher being used while uninitialized.
+ Added some shortcuts to the unsaved files dialog (Y/S to save, N to not save, C to cancel)
