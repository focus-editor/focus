# Contributing

We gratefully welcome bug reports and bug fixes.

Pull requests containing features are more likely to be rejected. However, you are encouraged to fork the editor and implement anything you need on top.

The base editor is intended to be kept simple forever. It means it will likely be "complete" at some point. It also means it will not include very many features.

The bigger the change, the more likely it is to be rejected. Please don't work on big changes that you want merged before checking with us on Discord or on GitHub.

Please remember that every pull request is not only a contribution, but also work for the maintainers.

Thank you!
