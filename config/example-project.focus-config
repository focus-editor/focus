[[workspace]]

[workspace dirs]
# These directories will be scanned when a workspace is opened so that search etc. works.
# Example:
# C:/projects/my-project
# C:/jai


# IMPORTANT:
# You can override any section from the global config in your project and it will be used when your project is active.
# Please note that some of the sections will completely replace the ones in the global config, while other sections
# will try to merge with the global config. E.g. the workspace sections such as [ignore dirs] will completely
# override the global [ignore dirs], which allows you to "unignore" some dirs just for your project!
# Empty sections are ignored.



# This is an example configuration for build commands

[[build commands]]
# build_working_dir:      <build working dir for all commands>
# open_panel_on_build:    true  #  <- any settings specified here will apply to all commands unless overridden
# close_panel_on_success: false
# clear_build_output_before_running: false
# error_regex:            <compiler-specific error regex>  # see examples below
# auto_jump_to_error:     false

# [Debug Build And Run]   # <- command name. Can be arbitrary
# build_command:          jai main.jai  # should be an executable or a script
# build_working_dir:      <build working dir for this command only>
# timeout_in_seconds:     5             # if you don't want a timeout, don't specify it
# run_command:            test.exe      # will be run if build succeeds
# run_working_dir:        W:/focus      # working dir for the run command
# key_binding:            F5

# [Run]                   # <- You could have commands that don't build anything and just run something
# run_command:            test
# run_working_dir:        /home/user/test
# key_binding:            Ctrl-F5

# [Release]
# build_command:          jai first.jai - release
# key_binding:            F9


# Example error regexes:
# For jai:  ^(?P<file>.*):(?P<line>\d+),(?P<col>\d+): (?P<type>Error|Warning|Info): (?P<msg>.*)|^(?P<msg>.*error LNK.*)
# For msvc: ^(?P<file>.*)\((?P<line>\d+),(?P<col>\d+)\): (?P<type>error|warning) (?P<msg>.*)$
# ... let us know what regex works for you and we'll add it here

# NOTE:
# You can use the following variables in build_command or run_command:
# %FILE%      - full path to currenly active file
# %FILE_DIR%  - the directory of the currently active file
# %FILE_NAME% - current file name, with extension
# %FILE_NAME_NO_EXTENSION% - current file name, without extension
# %BUILD_WORKING_DIR% - working dir of the build command
# %RUN_WORKING_DIR%   - working dir of the run command
